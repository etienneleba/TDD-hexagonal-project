# TDD-hexagonal-project

## Goal 

Discover the concepts of DDD, BDD, ATDD, TDD, living documentation and clean architecture by practicing


## Objectives

- Apply the strategic patterns and tactical patterns of domain driven design on a real project
- Use behavioral driven development to understand and clarify the product domain
- Transform the product domain understanding into acceptance tests
- Guide the project with the acceptance tests (acceptance tests driven development)
- Use tests driven development to guide de development and ensure in consequence the non-regression
- Document the project with code based documentation (living documentation)
- Create future-proof and decoupling application thanks to the hexagonal architecture
- Delimit the bounded contexts of the project
- Create a modular monolith based on the bounded contexts
- Become mouse-less when programming
- Master Git/Gitflow/Github and project management
